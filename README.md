# Covid-Data-Analysis-And-Visualisation
Real time covid data analysis using data from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. Data exploration done in SQL and visualisation in Tableau.

**Description:**
In this data analysis project, I meticulously analyzed the COVID-19 dataset from Our World in Data, which contains comprehensive information on deaths, infections, vaccinations, and relevant details across various countries and continents. The dataset was collected by a collaborative team including Edouard Mathieu, Hannah Ritchie, Lucas Rod√©s-Guirao, and others, ensuring credibility and accuracy.

To enhance data manageability and efficiency, I divided the initial dataset into two separate Excel files, "covid-deaths" and "covid-vaccination." Employing Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, I harnessed SQL queries to delve into the data and draw insightful conclusions. The project encapsulates several critical aspects of data analysis:

1. **Data Manipulation:** I imported the Excel files into SQL Server, using them to build structured tables. Employing Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and temporary tables, I optimized data retrieval for further analysis.

2. **Exploratory Analysis:** I conducted comprehensive analysis by utilizing SQL functions such as SUM, MAX, and aggregations. Key analyses included total deaths vs. total infections on a country-wise basis, infection rates across different countries, death counts by continent, daily death counts for each country, and population vs. total vaccinations.

3. **Visualization:** To facilitate intuitive comprehension of insights, I harnessed Tableau to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards. The provided Tableau dashboard serves as a culmination of my analysis, enabling users to dynamically explore the data trends, correlations, and patterns.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Proficiency in data preprocessing, cleaning, and structuring using SQL.
- Mastery of SQL queries for complex data manipulation and aggregation.
- Utilization of SQL functions and techniques like CTEs and temporary tables.
- Ability to transform raw data into meaningful insights through exploratory analysis.
- Expertise in creating visually compelling and interactive dashboards using Tableau.
- Effective communication of findings and insights through data visualization and presentation.
- Familiarity with version control and project management on GitHub.
